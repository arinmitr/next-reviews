I spent the majority of my six-hour playthrough of **Hellblade: Senua’s Sacrifice** grasping for a touchstone to understand the experience. It unfolds like a beautiful, dark, tense visual novel, placing the excellently raw, human performance of its main character front and center on her journey into the land of the Northmen. Her story is one of confusion, sadness, fear, and loss, and it’s punctuated by moments of beauty, and strength that has left a lasting impression on me.

It follows the titular Senua, a celtic warrior, who embarks on a mission to the homeland of the Northmen in order to penetrate the depths of their version of hell, the mythological Norse land of the dead called Helheim. It's bound by threads of historical fiction, historical non-fiction, mythology, and metaphor all admirably weaved together to create a unique backdrop that's ripe for exploring the darker tones and themes Hellblade tackles.

But as impressive as its story is, Ninja Theory’s smart design reinforces the sensory nature of the harrowing tale through subtle and intuitive mechanics. Even before the game begins, you're prompted to play with headphones in order to capitalize on the binaural audio design (simulated three-dimensional sound). This is used to great effect as the voices that plague Senua are in a constant chatter, dancing around her head in creepy ways that feel as though you're never alone.

And in truth, you never really are alone in Hellblade, for better or worse. These voices speak directly to Senua, each other, and perhaps even to you. They impart advice, they argue about her actions, they tear her down and pick her up at the best and most inopportune times. This fact, coupled with the excellent original score, the never-faltering voice work, and the ambient sounds both real and imagined make for an audial experience that's as vivid and liberal as anything that happens before your eyes.

Visually Hellblade is a gorgeous game to take in – sun-soaked rocky beaches, vividly distorted streaks of color and light, and deep darkness that strangles the screen, there's a variety of hues, saturation, and exposures that convey meaning in most areas. This variety is further improved when playing on the PS4 Pro, which makes use of an "enhanced resolution" or a smoother, more immersive 60 frames-per-second.

And while Ninja Theory is no stranger to including full-motion video in the past (Enslaved's use of Andy Serkis comes to mind), Hellblade's use takes it to another degree by splicing in real footage of secondary characters' performances through a heavily distorted filter that creates impactful scenes between real and animated characters without feeling out of place. I was consistently, pleasantly surprised by the number of ways Ninja Theory was able to present these moments, all without breaking the immersion of the world and story.

Its incredibly smart use of audio and visual distortion and trickery to convey the frightening effects of psychosis, hallucinations, and delusion, are married with the gameplay elements for an experience that rarely ever grapples over whether it’s a game or a story.

Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice is a masterclass of atmosphere, storytelling, and the marriage of mechanical and conceptual design. While there are moments that feel shoehorned in to remind us we’re playing a videogame, the care and attention Ninja Theory has clearly poured into Senua and her story has created something amazing. This is a game everyone should play, and I’m thankful for the opportunity to have lived inside the mind of Senua, however briefly.
