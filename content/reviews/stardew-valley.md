My favorite thing about **Stardew Valley** is not just that there’s a lot to see and do, but that it’s (almost) all intertwined. It’s not apparent at first — when I started my farm, I planned each tile for maximum efficiency and reset when I accidentally bought the wrong seeds. But the secret of the Valley is that it’s much more than making each day productive on the farm alone. As I ventured off my plot of 16-bit land and started to explore, I began to really enjoy the days for everything they are — and how its parts fit together to build a captivating rural life.

Each day in Stardew Valley takes around 10 to 20 real minutes, and several of them are occupied by the slow business of starting a farm from scratch. Having to plant the right seeds, water your crops, and wait for the harvest before making any real money means there’s not a lot to do right away. Fitting, since my character had just left a stifling job at the Joja Corporation — Stardew Valley’s ever-present reminder that capitalism can grow soulless — for a simpler life on grandpa’s old farm. But Stardew Valley isn’t simple. It’s relaxed, sure, and lets you grow at your own pace, but it’s a rich world once you get past the slow first season.

Life in Stardew Valley’s Pelican Town picked up for me around summer of the first year — by then I’d gained access to fishing, exploring the mines, and enough money to start investing in livestock. Things really started to come together, and that initial simplicity evolved into a quiet sort of busyness. I grew crops so that I could prepare the best food, which I could in turn give as gifts to win over the townsfolk or to take down with me into the mine to restore my health as I fought monsters to get resources, which I could use to build a useful item back on my farm. I then used ore from the mines to upgrade my tools so I could chop up a log and get to a secret part of the Valley, and all that work helped me level up so I could craft even better items. The blend of RPG and farm sim feels effortless, and it makes Stardew Valley exciting and compelling without being stressful.

Stardew Valley is a beautiful, fun game that, when all of its parts are pulled together, make for a wonderful countryside adventure. Whether it’s rainy, sunny, snowy, or dusted with pollen drifts through the air, each day offers an abundance of great activities ready to be collected or mastered and new friendships waiting to be made. Even 100 hours in with three in-game years in the books, I still feel like I have so many mysteries to discover, and plenty of items to collect. New items, goals, and events from all the updates since its launch make Stardew Valley more welcoming for new players and extends its life for seasoned farmers, too. The fantastic multiplayer is just the cherry on top of the cake to this marvelous farming RPG.
